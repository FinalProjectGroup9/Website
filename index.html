              <p><strong>The Norwegian Government</strong> and the food industry have signed an agreement to reduce food waste in Norway by 50 percent by 2030.</p>
              <p>One third of all food produced globally is spoiled or thrown away. In Norway alone, the average consumer throws out 42 kg edible food every year.
                Food waste in the entire food chain represents 68 kg per person per year.</p>

                  <p>By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail
                    and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains,

                  <p>Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable
                    practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle</p>

              <p>Our app directly targets these sustainable development goals from the United Nations.
                It is hard for people to know where to start to tackle such big and abstract problems.
                It gives you the chance to make a direct impact on a big problem concerning our city, country, and planet.</p>
                <p>
                You are given incentives to donate, receiving rewards the more you donate. You are also encouraged to transport food, with rewards for the top rankers. A monthly ranking system gives rewards to the top 3 donors and top transporters.
