              <p>The Fraction app creates a platform to redistribute food that would normally be thrown away.
                We cooperate with big businesses like cruise lines and grocery stores.
                We store the donated food at our central warehouse, where it can be picked up
                directly by people in need, or delivered to where you are by choosing this in the app.</p>
                <p>Our app directly targets these sustainable development goals from the United Nations.
                It is hard for people to know where to start to tackle such big and abstract problems.
                It gives you the chance to make a direct impact on a big problem concerning our city,
                country, and planet.</p>
              <p>
                You are given incentives to donate, receiving rewards the more you donate. You are also encouraged to transport food, with rewards for the top rankers.
                A monthly ranking system gives rewards to the top 3 donors and top transporters.
              </p>
              <p>The Fraction app creates a platform to redistribute food that would normally be thrown away.</p>
              <p>Fraction makes it easy for a business who wants to reduce their waste to redistribute the food into the hands of consumers and people in need.</p>
              <p>Fraction makes it easy for a consumer to find healthy affordable meals and be eco friendly at the same time.</p>
              <p>What sets us apart from similar solutions, is the option to find last minute deals in shops</p>

          Delivery from you to our central hub at FRACTION is free of charge.
          Prepare the food for pickup and our delivery-drivers will take care of the rest.
          By donating, you automatically will take part in the competition where you may win prizes for your company.

        <p>
          Do you want to take part as one of our delivery-drivers?
          This will be volunteer work and you would have to supply with your own car,
          but you will receive a part of the food you pick up and deliver for us completely free of charge.
          As a delivery-driver, you automatically will take part in the competition
          where you may win a gift card of 1000,- NOK should you be one of our top drivers.

          Are you an individual of low-income?
          We offer a place where you can get an overview over food in your vicinity at a low price.
          We also offer a central hub where you can get 1 portion of breakfast, lunch and dinner free of charge.
          We cannot promise that there is always food for everyone,
          but we will do our best to distribute the food we have as best we can. We also operate on a "first come, first served"
          as there is limited spacing. IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the corona-situation, our hub is now take-away only.
          GET CHEAP FOOD here and FREE FOOD here.
