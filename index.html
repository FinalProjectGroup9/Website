          <p>According to the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2020), the convention states have agreed to fight climate change in “a manner that does not threaten food production”.
      </p>
           <p>One way to work towards this goal is to redistribute food that would normally be thrown away and redistribute it to those who need it.</p>

             in mind, we have come up with the Fraction platform.</p>

        <p>
          We store the donated food at our central hub, where it can be picked up directly by people in need,
          or delivered to where you are by choosing this in the app.

          Our app gives you the chance to make a direct impact on a big problem concerning our planet.</p>
          <p>
        We cooperate with all kinds of businesses that deal with food: grocery stores, cafes, canteens, catering firms, restaurants and even primary sources like farms.</p>
        <p>We are an all-in-one-operation; the business, the delivery and the receivers are accessible at one place.</p>
          <p>A delivery function is implemented to save expenses and time for the companies who generously donate food. </p>
        <p>“Save of the day” feature in the app lists food that is expiring soon at a lower cost.
          Supermarkets register food close to the expiry date and they appear in our app.
